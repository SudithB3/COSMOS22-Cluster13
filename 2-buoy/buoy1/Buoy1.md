## Buoy #1:
### Objectives:
* Collect data via sensors that would be attached to the exterior of the buoy
* Communicate with base station in order to send data back to be analyzed

### Procedures:
For the body of our buoy, we used the CreekKooler floating cooler, which had the capacity to store the electronics necessary to accomplish the objectives listed above.

To fufill our objectives we had to first find a way to mount our sensors. [How we mounted the sensor](https://pages.github.com/)
