Team Members: Milan S, Daniel MS, Isabelle G, Giovanni M, Emily L

## Description:
During the COSMOS 2022 Summer Program, we created two buoys and a capsule responsible for the collection and distribution of data. Both buoys are towed by an autonomous boat and will collect data at certain intervals.

## Buoy #1:
### Objectives:

* Communicate with base station in order to send data back to be analyzed

### Procedures:
For the body of our buoy, we used the CreekKooler floating cooler, which had the capacity to store the electronics necessary to accomplish the objectives listed above.
