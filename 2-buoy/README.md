# Cluster 13 - Buoy Group
Team Members: Milan S, Daniel MS, Isabelle G, Giovanni M, Emily L

## Description:
During the COSMOS 2022 Summer Program, we created two buoys and a capsule responsible for the collection and distribution of data. Both buoys are towed by an autonomous boat and will collect data at certain intervals.

## Buoy #1:
### Objectives:
* Collect data via sensors that would be attached to the exterior of the buoy
* Communicate with base station in order to send data back to be analyzed

### Procedures:
For the body of our buoy, we used the CreekKooler floating cooler, which had the capacity to store the electronics necessary to accomplish the objectives listed above.

For our sensors, we used a pH probe sensor, a temperature sensor, and a total-dissolved-solids (TDS) sensor
