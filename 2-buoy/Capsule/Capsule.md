## Capsule

### Objectives:
* Create a capsule that can be easily lowered beneath the water
* Capsule has the capacity to collect data via sensors
* Capsule can send data back to buoy via serial communication

### Procedure:
For the body of the capsule, we used the Zulkit Junction Box, which was watertight and could thus protect the electronics inside.

Inside of the capsule, we used an Arduino nano to control the sensors and a battery pack to power the Arduino.

In order to allow the sensors to protrude from the capsule while also preventing water leakage, the sensors are threaded through cable grommets and secured in place using epoxy.
