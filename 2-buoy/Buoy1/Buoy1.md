## Buoy #1:
### Objectives:
* Collect data via sensors that would be attached to the exterior of the buoy
* Communicate with base station in order to send data back to be analyzed

### Procedures:
For the body of our buoy, we used the CreekKooler floating cooler, which had the capacity to store the electronics necessary to accomplish the objectives listed above.

To fufill our objectives we had to first find a way to mount our sensors. For our sensors, we used a pH probe sensor, a temperature sensor, and a total-dissolved-solids (TDS) sensor

To mount our sensors we decided to create a 3D printed part that can hold the sensors that we could then use hot glue or epoxy to affix it to the side of the buoy. 
We needed to create three diferent cad models so we can mount ech of our sensors. 
The first CAD design was created to hold the [Tempature sensor]([https://cad.onshape.com/documents/50829009a772264103478846/w/c708d828623270150ef75e4e/e/50d666d81c3724e23ea0e39a?renderMode=0&uiState=62ebf43992bb0f3bc595ef23]
It worked by having a curved side that matched the curvatiure of the buoy and a lego hand on the oposite side that would hold the wire. 
It would then be glued in to ensure no further movement.

Then next design was the [TDS sensor holder]([https://cad.onshape.com/documents/0d5282bba14a224c1724f533/w/94f34ff72025ca8cc00cb65f/e/ccd35523a7df853023de6571))
We designed it so we can slide the TDS sensor into it before glueing the curved edge to the side of the buoy.
We initial planned to only have it hold the sensor but while testing we realised that the TDs sensor probe was being damaged during testing so we designed a attachment that covers the pins so they would not be damaged.

The final sensor that we had to mount was the PH sensor. We noticed that we could slide part of the PH sensor off
