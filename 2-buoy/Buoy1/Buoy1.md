# Buoy #1:
## Objectives:
* Collect data via sensors that would be attached to the exterior of the buoy
* Communicate with base station in order to send data back to be analyzed

## Project Timeline

### 7/18
We created the first iteration of the CAD models to hold the sensors.[PH sensor](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ea41564105b61a12bdf0fd28/w/d3fdfa1f7d79284eb63dc095/e/69df08fe40578d68010a607e), [TDS sensor holder](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/0d5282bba14a224c1724f533/w/94f34ff72025ca8cc00cb65f/e/ccd35523a7df853023de6571) and the [Tempature sensor](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/50829009a772264103478846/w/c708d828623270150ef75e4e/e/50d666d81c3724e23ea0e39a?renderMode=0&uiState=62ebf43992bb0f3bc595ef23/)

### 7/19
We finished printing out the sensor mounts and temprorily attached them to the buoy using hot glue.

### 7/20 
We took the buoy out to the pool to test how everything was working. We discovered that the TDS sensor needed to be more protected so we redesigned the cad model to have part of it extend underneath to protect the pins.
