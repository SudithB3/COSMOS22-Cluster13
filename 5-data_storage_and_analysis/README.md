# COSMOS22-Cluster13

## Team 5: Data Analysis
We analyze the data, program the server and communication, process the data, make conclusions & cool models.

### BRAINSTORMING/PLANNING
During the first week of our 4-week program, our team worked on getting familiar with the project, what changes we would be making to our RC boat, dividing up tasks, learning CAD, and understanding Arduino. Below is a Gantt chart of our last 3 weeks that we created to map out our work.

Additonally, here is our initial brainstorming diagram displaying the flow of data towards the server from the boat/data buoy. This diagram is an overview of Groups 5, 6, and 7. The highlighted blue section on the right is what our team worked on and the formatting at the bottom is what our data looks like.

### WEEK 2
During the second week, our team learned about database structure using SQLite and created a database to store sensor, GPS, and timestamp data. We decided on using serial with Telemetry Team to transfer the data. Sebastian started working on transferring the data from serial to the database using Python. Dorothy and Tanmayi decided on Plotly Dash as the library for the dashboard and planned out the layout of the dashboard. Claire and Alex started to learn Python to create models. Claire delved into exploratory data analysis and started learning about K-means clustering, linear regression, and goodness of fit for our data analysis. Meanwhile, Alex set up the server with the Linux OS.

### WEEK 3
We worked on OLS and ANOVA models for data analysis, as well as continuing work on the dashboard. We completed dashboard plot code and tested the live updates on dashboard. Finally, we CADed the radio-to-stand connector of LoRa and server, an esp32 protective box, and LoRa reciever case. On Friday, we went to the Miramar Lake for the final test of our roboboat. We got to see data send to our dashboard and update on refresh!
